SOFTWARES USED:

1)Third Party system used - XAMPP 2)Framework Used - Joomla! 3.9 3)iFrame used - Pesapal

APPROACH USED : I used the Model-View-Controller design model to develop the user interface. The model represents the data and it is does not depend on the controller or the view. The view displays the model data, and sends user actions such as button clicks to the controller.

BASIC FUNCTIONALITY:

Xampp software is used as the backend to store the database data of all transactions posted to it.

The developed Joomla donations component will be installed as an extension into the Joomla! Framework and it will appear under the Joomla Components after a successful installation process.

Pesapal iFrame is integrated into the developed Joomla Component to enable the transacting of donation funds through pesapal.

A web service is integrated in the Donation Component developed and it uses JSON web tokens to post all payments (Pending,Failed and Completed ONLY) to XAMPP software.

The site administrators can log in to the back-end and view details regarding each donation (Donor’s name, email or phone number and amount), through the Joomla Framework.

A user is able to donate through a Donation Form.
